Please find my answers to the questions in TASK-2: OPEN QUESTIONS below:

Question 1: 1. What are typical measures for the quality of an audio file?

Answer: 
      (i) Bit rate: It denotes the amount of data encoded per unit of time in the audio file. Higher bitrate generally leads to better quality, but more data is used to represent the audio.
      (ii) Sample rate in Hertz :  It denotes the number of samples of audio taken per second. Higher sample rates capture more detail, hence better audio quality. (Same concept can be associated with bit depth)
      (iii) Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in db: It compares the level of the desired signal to the level of the noise. The higher the SNR, the better the quality.
      (iv) Other metrics proved successful in literature: SI-SDR (Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio), SI-SNR (Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Noise Ratio), and dynamic range
      
      Specifically for the speech signals the following metrics can be used:
      (i) STOI (Short-Time Objective Intelligibility):  It compares the short-time segments of the clean and degraded speech signals.
      (ii) PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality):  It compares the original and processed signals based on human perception to provide a quality score.
      (iii) MUSHRA (MUltiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor): It is a method used in subjective audio quality evaluation tests

Question 2: What would be your approach/method to make them comparable independent of the original audio recording setup?
